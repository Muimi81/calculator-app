# calculator-app
Browser-based calculator app built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This is a project I am undertaking to learn the fundamentals of modern front-end web development. Through the project, I built a functional calculator app using html, css and js.
The project is based on a YouTube step-by-step tutorial by <a href="https://youtu.be/cGgLHJGyS34?si=PnLFdovOglPMBMDw">GreatStack</a> channel. The tutorial walks through the process of designing the calculator's layout, adding buttons, and implementing the functionality for basic arithmetic operations.
